**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hey guys, for a personal project, I needed to test many timecycles but I couldn't find any resource that would allow me to do so. So I decided to make my own. This is a simple script that allows you to test all the timecycles in the game.

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-timecycle` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-timecycle` to your server.cfg
Then, once you're in game, use the command /timecycles to toggle the menu.

**Features :sparkles: :**
* Accessible config file
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Easy to use


*Demo :eyes:  :*

Feel free to open an Issue or make a PR to help me improve this resource !

*PS : I used this file to get the timecycle list so huge thanks to @DurtyFree : [gta-v-data-dumps](https://github.com/DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps)*
